Place the paper filter in the dripper and spread open to create a cone. Weigh the coffee beans (8 oz – 12 oz). Grind the coffee beans until the coffee grounds are the consistency of coarse sand, about 20 seconds. Transfer the grounds to the filter cone. Once the water has boiled, check the temperature of the water(The water should be between 195-205 degrees Fahrenheit or between 91-96 degrees Celsius). If the water is too hot, let it cool briefly. Pour a small amount of water into the filter to wet the grounds. Wait about 30 seconds for the coffee to bloom(You will see small bubbles or foam on the coffee grounds during this step). Slowly pour the rest of the water over the grounds in a circular motion. Do not overfill beyond the top of the paper filter. Let the coffee drain completely into the mug before removing the dripper.

                <td>Take a tomato and cut it into two pieces. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a small non-stick frying pan, then cook the tomatoes cut-side down until they start to soften and colour. Chop 2 tbsp cilantro. Meanwhile, crack one egg in a bowl and add the chopped cilantro and 1/2 tsp ground black pepper. Beat the contents of the bowl. Scoop the tomatoes from the pan and put tomatoes on a serving plate. Pour the egg mixture into the pan and stir gently with a wooden spoon so the egg that sets on the base of the pan moves to enable the uncooked egg to flow into the space. Stop stirring when it’s nearly cooked to allow it to set into an omelette. Transfer it to the plate and serve with the tomatoes. </td>

                <td>Place the paper cupcake liner inside the mug. Set aside. Measure and add 2 tbsp flour, 1.5 tbsp sugar, 1/4 tsp baking powder, and a pinch of salt to the mixing bowl. Whisk to combine. Measure and add 2 tsp vegetable oil, 2 tbsp water, and 1/4 tsp vanilla extract to the bowl. Whisk batter until no lumps remain. Pour batter into prepared mug. Microwave the mug and batter on high power for 60 seconds. Check if the cake is done by inserting and toothpick into the center of the cake and then removing it. If wet batter clings to the toothpick, microwave for an additional 5 seconds. If the toothpick comes out clean, continue. Invert the mug to release the cake onto a plate. Allow to cool until it is no longer hot to the touch, then carefully remove the paper liner. While the cake is cooling, prepare to pipe the frosting. Scoop 4 spoonfuls of chocolate frosting into a zip-top bag and seal, removing as much air as possible. Use scissors to cut one corner from the bag to create a small opening ¼-inch in diameter. Squeeze the frosting through the opening to apply small dollops of frosting to the plate in a circle around the base of the cake. </td>
